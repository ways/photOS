photOS v2.0 beta
================

Overview
--------

This is software for running a digital photo frame, using mostly ownCloud to populate it. Plugins for weather, video streaming, etc.

Requirements
------------
* This has only been tested on raspbian, but should work on Debian, Ubuntu and similar.
* Must run as user pi for now.
* Made to work with ownCloud, but can be adapted to Dropbox or no syncing at all.
* Familiarity with the CLI is probably needed.

Install
-------

* Set up a fresh raspbian.
* Copy photOS folder to /home/pi/
* Copy photOS/install/passwords.dist to photOS/install/passwords, and edit values.
* Run photOS/install/install.sh as user pi

* At the other end:
** Create an ownCloud user for this host on your ownCloud server. Share pictures and videos to that user, and they will automatically be synced.

Structure
