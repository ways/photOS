Features:
* Enable touch for photo, activies, status, shutdown.
* Plugin: slowTV

Problems:
* Latest oclient doesn't work. The version I'm on (0.3) is very moody. Perhaps I have to use the official client.

Organization:
* Make less dependant on owncloud? I.e. if one wants to use dropbox or none.
* Make less dependant on paths.
* Unsure if csync db will kill SD cards. Find and automate a solution. Temporary solution: external storage.
* Look at/merge files from photOS 1.0
